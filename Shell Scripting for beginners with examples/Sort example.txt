Step-by-Step Guide to Sort Names in a File
01-Prepare Your File:

Make sure you have a text file that contains the names you want to sort. For example, let's say your file is named names.txt, and it contains the following names:
Copy code
John
Alice
Bob
Charlie

02-Open the Terminal:

On Linux or macOS, open your terminal.

03-Use the sort Command:

To sort the names in ascending order, you can use the following command:
bash
Copy code
sort names.txt
This command will display the sorted names in the terminal.

04-Save the Sorted Output to a New File (Optional):

If you want to save the sorted names to a new file, you can use the output redirection operator (>):
bash
Copy code
sort names.txt > sorted_names.txt
This command will create a new file named sorted_names.txt containing the sorted names.
